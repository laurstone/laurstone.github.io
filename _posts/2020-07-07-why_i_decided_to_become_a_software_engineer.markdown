I graduated from a small school in Pittsburgh with a degree in PR and Advertising and have been working in the field since. However, during my time in college I did learn multiple different programs and how to use different media, including the basics of coding. I really enjoyed it, but at the time couldn't picture myself becoming a coder. Mostly because I had no idea what it required. 

During my first job in marketing I worked for a dental management group where I ran a marketing department for many dental offices involving digital and print medias. I quickly became close with our development team so that I could learn how to make quick changes to our site, help provide feedback for optimizations, and have an understanding of what we can do or not do to help the customer experience. Unfortunately, this job relocated but I still stay in touch with the members on the dev team. 

Recently, I became close with our dev team at another job and worked with them to launch our new site. During this experience my interest in coding and what I wanted to do with it became clear. I loved working with them on what can be done and what couldn't be done in order to make a customer-friendly and visually appealing site. Then I found Flatiron School and really wanted to find a time to get started. So here I am - starting my journey with you!
